An [RStudio Addin](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/) to help you insert ('stamp') useful little code blocks into your Quarto document.

See the [Quarto Docs](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) for information.

To install:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")  # if not yet installed
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/quartostamp")
```

Then restart and you'll see the functions under 'QUARTOSTAMP' in the Addins dropdown of the RStudio IDE.
