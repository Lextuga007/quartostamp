An R package containing an [RStudio Addin](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/) to help you insert ('stamp') useful little code blocks into your Quarto document.

See the:

* [package website](https://matt-dray.github.io/quartostamp/) for the [full list of available functions](https://matt-dray.github.io/quartostamp/reference/index.html)
* [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) for full documentation

To install this package:

``` r
install.packages("remotes")  # if not yet installed
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/quartostamp")
```

Then restart RStudio and you'll see the functions under 'QUARTOSTAMP' in the Addins dropdown.
